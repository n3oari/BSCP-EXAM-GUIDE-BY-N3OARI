> ❗This repository contains **my own** cheatsheets and methodologies for the exam — **not PortSwigger's**. You may consult PortSwigger's resources if you wish, but the files here are my personal notes.

> ❗I highly recommend creating **your own** cheatsheets. This repository is intended to help others, provide examples, show the overall organization, and demonstrate my work and methodologies.

> 💡🤓 This repository is a summary of all my Obsidian notes for the BSCP. I learned a lot while creating it because I focused on making it as clear and didactic as possible, fully internalizing all the concepts to be able to explain them correctly. This repo was created **before passing the exam**.

The following are basic resources offered by PortSwigger for the exam:

- [usernames wordlist](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)  
- [passwords wordlist](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)  
- [URL validation bypass cheat sheet (SSRF)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/url-validation-bypass-cheat-sheet)  
- [delimiters wordlist (web cache deception)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-deception/wcd-lab-delimiter-list)

---

The exam consists of **2 machines**, each with **3 phases**, and a duration of **4 hours**.
  - 1: Access any user account.
  - 2: Elevate privileges or compromising the administrator account.
  - 3: Exfiltrate contents of /home/carlos/secret and **submit solution**
